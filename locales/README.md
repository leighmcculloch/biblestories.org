# Translation Spiel

Include the following in translation requests:

> The text being translated is for https://greatstoriesofthebible.org. The English text included in this order is the remaining text that you can see in context at http://dev.greatstoriesofthebible.org/__/. The bible text and references are translated into ______ already, and the text being translated (and included in the order) is all the other text.

> One of the pieces that needs translations won't make much sense unless you see it in context. Click on a story on the home page and you'll be taken to the story pages. At the top you will see two A's of different sizes. Clicking them will englarge or shrink the text. The `V` is an abbreviation of `Verses`, and is visible when the website is viewed on mobile (resize your browser to be very small and you will see the `Verses` button will change to `V`). If there is a better way or symbol to represent these in ______, please translate to that.
