# Great Stories of the Bible

Have you seen someone share a Bible verse? Probably. Have you seen someone share an entire Bible story? Probably not. Why is this? We share links to long form articles everyday. Itâ€™s the relationship we have to linking to a chunk of text vs linking to a story. We share verses as an intellectual exercise, but the Bible is about people and God, characters and their relationships.

[Great Stories](http://greatstories.org) presents the bible as short stories. Jump in, read a story and share it.
