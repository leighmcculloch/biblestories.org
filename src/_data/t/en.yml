    Have you seen a bible verse shared on social media? Probably.
    Have you seen a bible story shared on social media? Unlikely.
    We share verses to share insights, but the bible is more than insights. The bible is about God and his relationship with people.
    We share links to articles everyday, why don't we share stories from the bible? I think it's because bible stories aren't well defined outside of childrens books. It's difficult to share a chunk of text but much easier to share something when it's presented in a conceptually tangible form, like an article or story.
    Great Stories presents the bible as short stories, easy to read and share.
